# PlayStation Clone Website

What is this?
This is just a documenting progress project. Here, I exercise what I learned from FreeCodeCamp, Youtube, and Udemy as of 1/21/22 to create a clone site of the PlayStation website. Currently, it was meant to be built for monitors 1900x1080 and above. Still learning Mobile. 

Focus?
This project focuses on the practice of the current skills to create the PlayStation website format as close as possible.  I am about 50% finished with FreeCodeCamp's CSS portion and 5/9 sections finished with the "Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS" udemy course.

What am I looking for?
Currently looking for feedback to develop better practices in my code. Images, logos, and symbols were directly drawn from the playstation website at the time.
