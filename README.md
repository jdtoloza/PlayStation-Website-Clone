# PlayStation Clone Website
Here, I exercise what I learned from FreeCodeCamp, Youtube, and Udemy as of 1/21/22 to create a clone site of the PlayStation website. This project focuses on the practice of the current skills to create the PlayStation website format as close as possible.  I am about 50% finished with FreeCodeCamp's CSS portion and 5/9 sections finished with the "Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS" udemy course. Currently looking for feedback to develop better practices in my code. Images, logos, and symbols were directly drawn from the playstation website at the time.
